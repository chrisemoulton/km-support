Heroku has a read-only filesystem, which means we won't be able to write any logfiles. You are still able to use the official [Ruby Library][ruby], but synchronously, without cron job support.

Another option people have used in the past is <https://github.com/vbrendel/delayed_km>. This isn't a gem officially supported by us, but it has been successfully used on Heroku.

[ruby]: /apis/ruby
