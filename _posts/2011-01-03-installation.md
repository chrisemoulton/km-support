1. The first step is to install your tracking script (found in your [site settings][settings]) after the opening `<head>` tag on every page of your site. (If you're wondering if it's possible to move the script lower down the page, please [read about our recommendation][top-v-bottom].)

2. Once the script has been installed, it may take anywhere from 2 to 6 hours for tracking to start. We will send you an email notification when data starts becoming available.
