This style guide will help you create visually consistant articles for the Kissmetrics Support site. Articles are written in Markdown and automatically converted to HTML. More information including a complete list of [Markdown syntax formatting can be found at Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics).

## Header Examples

The primary header for each article is a h1 element. Article headers are reserved for individual page titles only and are only used once per page.

	# This will style a First-Level Header

## Second-Level Header

The secondary header above is a h2 element, which may be used for any form of important page-level header. More than one may be used per page. Consider using a h2 unless you need a header level of less importance, or as a sub-header to an existing h2 element.

	## This will style a Second-Level Header

### Third-Level Header

The header above is a h3 element, which may be used for any form of page-level header which falls below the h2 header in a document hierarchy. More than one may be used per page.

	### This will style a Third-Level Header

#### Fourth-Level Header

The header above is a h4 element, which may be used for any form of page-level header which falls below the h3 header in a document hierarchy. More than one may be used per page.

	#### This will style a Fourth-Level Header

## Paragraphs

Paragraphs are created by simply separating the text by one or more blank lines.

	// Blank line above paragraph

	This will style a paragraph of text and wrap it in between two `<p>` tags. The paragraph will naturally wrap until a blank line is used.

	// Blank line separating paragraphs

	Here is another paragraph seperated by a blank line.

	// Blank line below paragraph

To achieve a `<br />` instead of a paragraph can be done by ending a line with two or more spaces, then type return.

	This will force a break in the text
	by converting two spaces and a return into a <br />

* * *

## Blockquotes

The blockquote element represents a section that is being quoted from another source.

Here’s an example of correct usage:

> Kissmetrics changed our view on what a company should be tracking. Kissmetrics tracks data that is important to your business and it shows you how to improve those numbers. Jane Park, CEO/Founder of Julep Entrepreneur

	> Kissmetrics changed our view on what a company should be tracking.
	> Kissmetrics tracks data that is important to your business and it shows you how to improve those numbers.
	> Jane Park, CEO/Founder of Julep Entrepreneur

## Code Blocks

Pre-formatted code blocks are used for writing about programming or markup source code. Rather than forming normal paragraphs, the lines of a code block are interpreted literally. Markdown wraps a code block in both `<pre>` and `<code>` tags.

Jekyll supports using [Pygments](http://pygments.org/) to style your code blocks. Here’s an example.

Our JavaScript code snippet looks like this:

{% highlight html %}
<script type="text/javascript">
  var _kmq = _kmq || [];
  var _kmk = _kmk || 'foo';
  function _kms(u){
    setTimeout(function(){
      var d = document, f = d.getElementsByTagName('script')[0],
      s = d.createElement('script');
      s.type = 'text/javascript'; s.async = true; s.src = u;
      f.parentNode.insertBefore(s, f);
    }, 1);
  }
  _kms('//i.kissmetrics.com/i.js');
  _kms('//doug1izaerwt3.cloudfront.net/' + _kmk + '.1.js');
</script>
{% endhighlight %}

You can pass a number of languages as an argument. You'll find a lot of use out of `html`, `html+ruby`, `js`, and `js+ruby` lexers. All the languages supported are listed at the [Pygments site](http://pygments.org/docs/lexers/).

## Inline Text

Some inline text can be styled to help add emphasis or importance to. These include `em`, `strong`, and `code`.

### Em

Markdown treats asterisks (*) and underscores (_) as indicators of emphasis. Text wrapped with one * or _ will be wrapped with an HTML `<em>` tag

*This is an example of emphasized text*

	*This will style text and wrap it in <em> tags.*

### Strong

Double `*`’s or `_`’s will be wrapped with an HTML `<strong>` tag.

**This is an example of emphasized text**

	**This will style text and wrap it in <strong> tags.**

### Code

To indicate a span of code, wrap it with backtick quotes (\`). Unlike a pre-formatted code block, a code span indicates code within a normal paragraph. For example:

`Referrer` indicates the URL the visitor came from

can be written like this:

	`Referrer` indicates the URL the visitor came from

## Links

Markdown supports two styles for creating links: inline and reference. With both styles, you use square brackets to delimit the text you want to turn into a link.

Inline-style links use parentheses immediately after the link text. For example:

	This is an [example link](http://example.com/).

Reference-style links allow you to refer to your links by names, which you define elsewhere in your document:

	I get 10 times more traffic from [Google][1] than from
	[Yahoo][2] or [MSN][3].

	[1]: http://google.com/        "Google"
	[2]: http://search.yahoo.com/  "Yahoo Search"
	[3]: http://search.msn.com/    "MSN Search"

## Lists

Markdown supports ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists.

Unordered lists use asterisks, pluses, and hyphens

### Example lists and usage:

**This is an unordered list**

- This is a list item
- This is a list item
- This is a list item

		- This is a list item
		- This is a list item
		- This is a list item

Ordered lists use numbers followed by periods:

**This is an ordered list**

1. This is list item 1
2. This is list item 2
3. This is list item 3

		1. This is list item 1
		2. This is list item 2
		3. This is list item 3

## Horizontal Rules

You can produce a horizontal rule tag `<hr />` by placing three or more hyphens, asterisks, or underscores on a line by themselves. If you wish, you may use spaces between the hyphens or asterisks. Each of the following lines will produce a horizontal rule:

## Images

Markdown uses an image syntax that is intended to resemble the syntax for links, allowing for two styles: inline and reference.

Inline image syntax looks like this:

	![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg)

	![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg "Optional title")

Reference-style image syntax looks like this:

	![Alt text][id]

Where “id” is the name of a defined image reference. Image references are defined using syntax identical to link references.

## Wistia Videos

When embeding Wistia videos, use the inline API method which will look similar to this:

    <div id="wistia_id" class="wistia_embed" style="width:488px;height:275px;" data-video-width="488" data-video-height="275">
    </div>

Then, remove any inline styles on the `<div>` tag and add the CSS class "wistia-embed" so that it looks similar to this:

    <div id="wistia_id" class="wistia_embed wistia-embed" data-video-width="488" data-video-height="275">
    </div>

The line break before the closing `</div>` is important for certain Markdown interpreters from adding the content below the video into the Wistia div.
