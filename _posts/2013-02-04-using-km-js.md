title: JavaScript Library - Running an A/B Test with KM.ab
categories: apis
summary: The Kissmetrics JavaScript Library provides a JS function to help you set up the A/B test. It does the three things every A/B test needs, all in one fell swoop. However, it requires you to edit some JavaScript on your site, though. Read here for some examples.

The Javascript API provides a function, `KM.ab`, to set up the majority of the A/B test. Specifically, it does three things:

1. Randomly assigns the current visitor to one of the variations passed in. (`KM.ab` returns the variation that was assigned, so you can save it as a JS variable.)
2. Ensures that subsequent calls to `KM.ab` returns the same variation for the visitor.
3. Sets a Kissmetrics property with the name of your experiment, and the value is the selected variant. In our example below, the A/B test will set the property "**Signup Button Color**" to either "**red**" or "**green**". You will be able to segment any report using this property.

# Full Example

Below shows an example of a complete A/B test, using `KM.ab`:

{% highlight html %}
<!--
  Here is our signup button. Notice that it is hidden by
  setting the style to "display: none". Also notice that
  it is by default using the "green" image.
-->
<img src="/images/green.png" id="signup_button" style="display: none"/>

<script type="text/javascript">
  // If for some reason Kissmetrics doesn't load or there is an error we'll just show the default green button after 1.5s
  var abTimeout1 = setTimeout(function(){
    document.getElementById("signup_button").style.display = '';
  }, 1500);

  // Now we need to add some Javascript code to run our A/B test.
  // Using _kmq.push to call our setup function ensures that it is only called once KM is loaded.
  _kmq.push(function(){
    // Set up the experiment (this is the meat and potatoes)
    var color = KM.ab("Signup Button Color", ["red", "green"]);

    // Set the button color
    var button = document.getElementById("signup_button");
    button.src = "/images/"+color+".png"; // Set the button color
    button.style.display = ''; // Show the button

    // Clear the timeout, since this worked fine
    clearTimeout(abTimeout1);
  });

  // Record when someone clicks on the button
  _kmq.push(["trackClick", "signup_button", "Clicked Signup"])
</script>
{% endhighlight %}

### Explaining KM.ab

Let's take a closer look at what KM.ab() does:

{% highlight js %}
var color = KM.ab("Signup Button Color", ["red", "green"]);
{% endhighlight %}

* For each person seeing this A/B test, choose randomly between the available options **"red"** and **"green"**.

* Sets a property "Signup Button Color" with the value "red" or "green", depending on what was randomly chosen.

This is equivalent to:

{% highlight js %}
// Only one of these is "executed":
_kmq.push(['set', {'Signup Button Color':'red'}]);   // option 1
_kmq.push(['set', {'Signup Button Color':'green'}]); // option 2
{% endhighlight %}

* `KM.ab()` returns which variation is picked, to reuse as a JavaScript variable (`color`). *To remember which variation was used, KM sets a cookie. Please look at our page on [Developing Locally][local] if you are testing `KM.ab()` locally.*

## Notes

* Wrap the call to `KM.ab()` in a function that is pushed to `_kmq`, or you may encounter JS errors if our library has not completely loaded before this executes.
* Our JavaScript library depends on cookies to work properly. Browsers do not preseve cookies from page to page in `localhost`, so please refer to our guide on [developing locally][local].

# Weighted Variants

When you use `KM.ab()` to set up a test, we'll split the variations evenly by default. However, you can give the function an extra argument to indicate the distribution of the test. These are all valid options:

{% highlight js %}
_kmq.push(function(){
  // Even weights, 50% red, 50% green (default)
  KM.ab("Button Color", ["red", "green"])

  // 70% red vs. 30% green
  KM.ab("Button Color", {"red":70, "green":30});

  // 70% red vs. 30% green, using decimals
  KM.ab("Button Color", {"red":0.7, "green":0.3});

  // 5:1 red vs. green
  KM.ab("Button Color", {"red":5, "green":1});


  // KM.ab works with more than just two alternatives
  // 33% red, 33% green, 33% blue
  KM.ab("Button Color", ["red", "green", "blue"])

  // 5:1:1 red vs. green vs. blue
  KM.ab("Button Color", {"red":5, "green":1, "blue":1})
})
{% endhighlight %}
