Kissmetrics is a person-based analytics product that helps you identify, understand, and improve the metrics that drive your online business. We answer many important questions that people are asking. Here are just a few... 

* Do you know which marketing campaign brought John Doe to your site?
* Which buttons / pages did John Doe click before he ultimately signed up / started paying you?
* What search terms are bringing the most visitors — and customers — to your site?
* How far are users getting in your upgrade or installation process? Which step did they get hung up on...and who are those users?
* Where are you losing potential customers?
* What do people who convert to customers have in common?
