## When will I receive the scheduled report emails?

We will run and deliver reports at **8AM** in the timezone of your product. The 8AM delivery time and your report's data will reflect the timezone selected in the [Product Settings page](https://app.kissmetrics.com/product.edit).

For example, if the timezone of your product is set to Pacific Standard Time, and you schedule a report to run every week on Wednesday, then the report runs every week at 8AM Pacific Standard Time.
