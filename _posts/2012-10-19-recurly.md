If you have been using [Recurly][recurly] to track [**transactions**][transactions], you can now import event data about the people who purchased or refunded.

*We have not yet added support for tracking* ***subscriptions*** *but may plan to in the future. Please let us know if you are interested in this integration!*

## Integration Details

Event Name | Properties | Identity
-----------| ---------- | --------
`Billed`. Alternatively, if you've [mapped a different event to our "Billed" event][mapping], we'll use this event from your mappings. | `Billing Amount`: (positive transaction amount) | Email address, according to Recurly
`Refunded` | `Billing Amount`: (negative transaction amount) | Email address, according to Recurly

#### Frequency of Import
