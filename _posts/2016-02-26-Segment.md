# What is Segment?

[Segment](https://segment.com/) is a service that helps marketers to more easily setup and manage multiple Analytics platforms with one unified API. Instead of learning a different data collection API for each service, Segment will collect your data and forward it on to each individual service for you.

# How do I get started?

If you would like to start sending us data via Segment, they have some [great documentation](https://segment.com/docs/integrations/kissmetrics/) that will help you get started. It thoroughly explains all of the little details of the integration, how it works, and what to look out for.
