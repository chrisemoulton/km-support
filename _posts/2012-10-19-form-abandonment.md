**Note: This method requires jQuery**.

Duncan's post on the [Distilled blog][distilled] demonstrates how to track form abandonment in Google Analytics. You can adapt the same JavaScript and jQuery code to track each form input as individual Kissmetrics events.

# The Code

{% highlight html %}
<script type='text/javascript'>
// Wait for jQuery to finish loading
$(document).ready(function() {

  // For all inputs, trigger an event after the browser loses focus from a field
  $(':input').blur(function () {

    // Check that the visitor entered some information in the field
    if($(this).val().length > 0) {
      _kmq.push(['record', 'Filled Out Form Step ' + $(this).attr('name')]);
      }
    });

  // For radio buttons and checkboxes, .change() works better than .blur()
  $('input:radio, input:checkbox').change(function () {
    _kmq.push(['record', 'Filled Out Form Step ' + $(this).attr('name')]);
    });
});
</script>
{% endhighlight %}

This is fairly simple, and the relevant comments are in-line. This also assumes `_kmq` has already been initialized earlier.

This will trigger a unique event for each form field that is filled out. The events will  `Filled Out Form Step FORM_STEP`, where `FORM_STEP` is replaced by the **Name** attribute of each `<input>`.

# Reporting

Once people have successfully filled out the form, you can set up a [Funnel Report][funnel] to look at the micro-funnel of their progression from input to input.

# Thoughts

As Duncan says, the code sample is a proof of concept, and we strongly suggest before installing to your live site, that you [test][testing] that the events you see are the ones you expect. This is important if you have many different forms to track, so that you can anticipate creating more specifically-named events for each form:

* *Filled Out Form Step FORM_STEP* vs.
* *Filled Out* ***Registration*** *Form Step FORM_STEP* vs.
* *Filled Out* ***Checkout*** *Form Step FORM_STEP*
