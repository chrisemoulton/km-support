# Why can’t I see my Engagements?

Here are a few a reason why you may not see your Engagement:

1. Do you fit your specific criteria? If you do not fit into your specified audience, frequency, placement or triggers, you will not see your Engagement. 

2. Are you A/B testing? If you are A/B testing, you may not see your own Engagement. Only 50% of your audience will be shown the Engagement. 

3. If you are targeting a specific page make sure you have specified whether the page is http or https. 

# What logic hierarchy does Engage use to show campaigns on my website?

# How long does it take from launching my Engagement to being live on my site?
