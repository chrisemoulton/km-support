## Kissmetrics will show you:

* How people are coming to your site
* Which channels are bringing you the most people who convert to customers
* What your conversion rate is
* Where people are falling out of your signup or checkout process
* How successfully customers are onboarding and getting started with your site
* Who the customers are who start a trial and never start using your product
* Whether your customers are really using the core features of your site
* And much more.

### For example…

Kissmetrics automatically tracks search terms, so you can see which terms are bringing the most visitors to your site as well as the highest percentage of visitors who convert into customers. You may learn that customers are finding you through an unexpected search, or that the paid search terms you’re using are not performing well.

### For example…

You may notice that a particular product review is driving a lot of conversions on your site. You should read through that review and see if they’re using any particularly compelling images or phrases that you may want to incorporate into your own marketing.

### For example…

Measure a baseline of your conversion rate. Then keep measuring it as you try out new landing page variations so you can be confident which changes are improvements.

### For example…

You’ll see right away if your customers are making it through 3 of your 4 signup steps – and know that your highest priority is fixing step 4 so they can start becoming customers instead of dropouts.

### For example…

After conversion, track the steps necessary for your customer to complete setup and really start getting value from your product. If they’re getting stuck, you can identify them and follow up with an email to guide them through the process.

### For example…

You thought Feature X was your “killer app”, but you can see that most of your customers aren’t accessing it at all. You may want to hold off on additional development until you confirm that it really is something your customers need.
