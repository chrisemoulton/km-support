# How to Create an Engagement
There is no better time than now, let’s create an Engagement!
Navigate to the Engage tab, you can find this in the main menu bar. In the upper right hand corner, select “CREATE ENGAGEMENT”.

![Create Engagement][SS1]

## Step 1: Pick Conversion

![Pick Conversion][SS2]

This is where you will define what a conversion means to you. Is this when a visitors completes the signup form or upgrades their account? Your conversion can be based on when a specific URL is viewed or an event you already have set up in Analyze.


## Step 2: Pick Trigger

![Pick Trigger][SS3]

There are three ways to trigger an Engagement, when a user is idle for a duration of time, when a user scrolls down to a section of your page or after a page loads.

* **Idle for a duration:** If a visitor doesn’t do anything for a while, trigger an action. When you select this option you will be prompted to select the amount of time in seconds or minutes,  a visitor should be idle before they are prompted with an Engagement.
* **Scroll to a page section:** If a visitor scrolls down to a section of your page, trigger an action. When you select this option you will be prompted to select “¼ down the page”, “halfway down the page”, “¾ down the page” or “to the bottom of the page”.
* **After page loads:** When a visitor lands on a page, trigger an action. You will add the URL where this occurs in a future step.


## Step 3: Design Action

You’ve made it to the fun part! What type of Engagement would you like to use? You have the following five options:

![Pick Design, Step 1 type][SS4]

* **Bar:** Show a bar at the top of the screen for announcements or promotions.
* **Bumper:** Show a window on the lower right side of the screen for recommended areas or articles.
* **Lightbox:** Show a window that shows up in the middle of a screen and darkens the background.
* **Pop-up:** Show a window that shows up in the middle of a screen.
* **Notification:** Show a window on the upper right side of the screen for short messages and announcements.

![Pick Design, Step 2 text][SS5]

Depending on the Engagement type, you will have the below options to fill in:

1. Heading Text
2. Body Text
3. Button Text
4. Clickthrough URL
5. Lightbox style - Light, Dark or Custom<br/> - Select Custom if your would like to brand your Engagement with your own custom colors.
6. Preview on my site - this allows you to see the changes you have made on your own site.

## Step 4: Choose Targeting

You are almost there! This is the step where you are going to select who will see the Engagement, where they will see it, when they will see it and if you would like to A/B test your campaign.

### Audience

![Choose Target, Select your audience][SS6]

Who do you want to be affected by your Engagement? You can either select everyone on your site or specify segments of your traffic. If you select to specify segments of your traffic you will have the following options:


#### Which Audience segment do you want to target?

* **Direct:** Visits from direct referrers, typing your site into the browser, or bookmarks
* **Organic:** Visits from search engines
* **Social:** Visits from social networks/sites
* **Paid:** Visits from Paid sources such as cpc, cpm, display, ppc, and more
* **Email:** Visits from emails
* **Referral:** Visits from 3rd party

#### Target traffic from specific referrers
Enter a list of referrer domains or URLs. You can add multiple items at one time.

#### Target traffic from campaign sources
Enter the source of specific campaigns that you would like to target with your Engagement. If the URL is “www.example.com/?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=test”, you will enter “facebook”. You can add multiple sources at one time.

### Placement

![Choose Target, Select your placement][SS7]

### Frequency

![Choose Target, Select your frequency][SS8]

How often will people see this campaign?

* **Only once:** We'll show your Engagement only once for the lifetime of the visitor. Best for one-time messages and announcements that people need to only see once. If visitors use a different browser, device, or clears their cookies, they will see the Engagement again.

If you are targeting multiple pages on your site, visitors will see the Engagement once in their visit or session.
* **Until visitor interacts:** We'll show your Engagement until a visitor has clicked the Engagement or dismissed it. Best for messages that you want to show constantly until the campaign receives an action. If you are targeting multiple pages on your site, visitors will see the Engagement on multiple pages.

### Experiment
