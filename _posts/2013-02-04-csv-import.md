You can import .csv files into Kissmetrics to import data into your account. We'll accept both one-time uploads and a recurring import of .csv files from your Amazon S3 Bucket.

We recommend you read [People, Events, and Properties][pep] and [Common Methods][common-methods] before getting started here.

# File Format

Columns will have the bold titles. These are the two required fields:

* **"Identity"** (required): Each entry is a KM identity. We will accept both new identities and identities already in our database.
* **"Timestamp"** (required, except when importing aliases): Each entry contains a timestamp of when the event/property occurred. The time format is in **seconds as a UTC Unix epoch**. If you are using dates in Excel, you may need to convert those dates to Unix timestamps. See [this answer on Stack Overflow][stackoverflow].

Then include at least one of these three columns, depending on what type of data you're importing:

* **"Event"** (*optional*): You can add an event name, such as `Signed Up`. It does not matter if you currently have data for this event, or if this is a completely new event. **If you are importing events, each row needs an event. To set only properties, set those aside in a separate CSV file.**
* **"Prop:"Property Name** (*optional*): You can add property columns by giving them the title `Prop:` and then adding the property name. For example, `Prop:Age` or `Prop:Billing Amount`. You can include up to 10 property columns.
* **"Alias"** (*optional*): in the rare case you are uploading [aliases][alias], you can add additional aliases to the KM identity.

Our CSV import is unable to accept double quotation marks (") so please use single quotations (') if possible.
