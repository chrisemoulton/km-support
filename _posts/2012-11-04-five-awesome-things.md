With Kissmetrics, you'll get the information you need to make better product and marketing decisions. Kissmetrics works through a combination of getting our Javascript on your site and setting up custom events to measure the most important behaviors that your customers take on your site.

Record a new event for each action you are measuring: for example, when a visitor views a landing page, or signs up, or purchases. These events are the key building blocks that will allow you to...

## 1. See your business at a glance
Create different [Metrics][metrics] to see your Event and Property data in the aggregate, across the date range you select.

## 2. Pinpoint where you're losing customers
Create a [Funnel Report][funnels] to see your customers' progress through a set series of events, and where is the biggest dropoff in that flow.

![2nd Awesome Thing][2]

## 3. See how effective your features/flows/campaigns are
Our [Cohort Report][cohort] lets you see the time it takes a customer to go from doing one event to another. They are segmented into cohorts based on time, or a common property (like which ad brought them to your site).

## 4. Find the people who didn't complete their purchase
The [People Search][people-search] provides you a list of customers based on criteria you define: show all the people who did X but did not do Y.

## 5. Zoom in on one specific customer
From our People Search, you can navigate to [individual customers][individual] and examine their event activity.
