## Section 2. How do I import previous transactions?

Please refer to our page on [Importing Data][import]. The properties are somewhat unique, so you'll most likely find yourself writing a little code to work with your backend servers or payment platform's API.


## Section 3. I have already been tracking revenue. How do update my old payments with the recommended structure?

Again, your best bet will be to [Import the Past Data][import]. Chances are you have a way to refer back to *who* was billed *when*...with that information, you can use the appropriate method of importing data to set the new properties you haven't been tracking, like "Subscription Billing Length".
