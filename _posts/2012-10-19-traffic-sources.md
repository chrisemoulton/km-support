If you've installed our [JavaScript Library][js], then we'll be recording where people come from to get to your site. Information about traffic sources can be seen across several Kissmetrics properties:

* `Referrer` - *any* site that links to your site
* `Search Engine` and `Search Terms` - includes paid and organic search terms
* `Campaign _____` - appears for URLs tagged with [UTM variables][utm]

You can segment your funnels and metrics using these properties to see where your traffic is coming from.
