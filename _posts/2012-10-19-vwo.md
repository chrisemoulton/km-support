[Visual Website Optimizer][1] gives you a lot of options for setting up A/B or multivariate tests on your site. Please refer to [their KnowledgeBase][2] for setup details.

Once customers visit one of your tests, they will be assigned a Kissmetrics property that indicates which variation they saw. Segment any of your reports by that property to compare performance along that page variation.
