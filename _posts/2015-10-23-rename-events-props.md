If you would like to rename your Events or Properties, you will only need to change the display name. This can be edited within the app. It is important to not change the name in your code. If you change the name in your codebase you will be creating a new event, not just renaming the old event.

## Step 1 - Go to Site Settings
Select **Site Settings**, the gear in the upper-right corner of the top navigation.

## Step 4 - Click the appropriate tab for Events or Properties
At the top of the page select Events or Properties depending on which you are trying to rename.

## Step 5 - Find the Event or Property and update the display value
Navigate to the property you are looking to update. Once you do that you can click on the property and update the **Display Name** and save your changes.
