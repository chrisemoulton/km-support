## Password Requirements

We require passwords to have **at least 8 characters and 2 numbers or symbols**.

## If you cannot log in

* In the Login window on our homepage, we'll provide a [link][forgot-pw] if you have forgotten your password:

![Reset Password][reset-ss]

* After following the steps, you will be sent a password reset email from support@kissmetrics.com (delivered by SendGrid). Please keep this address whitelisted.

If you suspect you have unsubscribed or if the email is not getting delivered for any other reason, please contact us!

## If you can log in

* After logging in, navigate to your [Account Details][edit-account]:

![Change Password][change-ss]

* Enter your new password and Save Changes.
