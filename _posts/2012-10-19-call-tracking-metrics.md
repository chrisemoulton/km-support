[Call Tracking Metrics][ctm] provides trackable phone numbers for your marketing campaigns. Imagine this scenario:

*You place multiple ads in the Wall Street Journal, and you list a unique phone number for each ad, all of which forward to your sales team.*

With Call Tracking Metrics, you can find out:

* Which phone conversation came from which ad?
* Who on your team picked up the phone, and did the caller buy during that conversation?

With Call Tracking Metrics **AND** Kissmetrics, you can connect the dots between phones calls, website activity, and email opens/clicks. Kissmetrics reports will let you answer:

* How do your callers interact with your website after the call?
* If deals are not closed over a call, does the person eventually buy through your website, without contacting your sales team?
* How much lifetime revenue comes from people who called at some point vs. those who have never called?

## Aliasing Phone Numbers to Email Addresses

Call Tracking Metrics provides an area to add notes about the caller. They provide a field for you to enter the caller's email address, if you know it (click the screenshot to expand):

Entering an email address aliases the email to the caller's phone number, so that events registered under either ID will represent the same person in Kissmetrics. This is key in tying together the call information you receive from this integration to the existing data you already collect online in Kissmetrics.
