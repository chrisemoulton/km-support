Our Python Library has the basic functionality laid out in our [API specifications][specs]. It allows you to record events and set properties. However, you might miss these features:

* No built-in mechanisms for generating and saving identities for your users
* No built-in mechanisms for automatically tying together *anonymous* and *named* identities.
* No built-in mechanisms for running A/B tests
* No automatic triggering of Events (such as detecting Search Engine traffic)
* Does not support [scheduling sending data via cron][cron]

For these reasons we recommend our JavaScript Library to our users, and to use the Python Library for recording events that occur server-side (account Upgrades may be an example of one such event). You might also consider looking at [other APIs][other] our customers have created.

# Setup

You can download a copy of the API from:

<https://github.com/kissmetrics/py-KISSmetrics>

You will need your API key which you can find in your [site settings][site-settings].

# Example Calls

{% highlight python %}
import KISSmetrics  # Load the KISSmetrics library
KM = KISSmetrics.Client('mySuperSecretApiKey')  # Initialize a client with a valid API key

KM.record('bob@bob.com', 'Viewed Homepage')
KM.record('bob@bob.com', 'Signed Up', {'Plan' : 'Pro', 'Amount' : 99.95})
KM.record('bob@bob.com', 'Signed Up', 1234567890)  # Pass in an optional timestamp
KM.set('bob@bob.com', {'gender': 'male'})
{% endhighlight %}

# Additional Reading

There are more detailed examples and documentation at <http://py-kissmetrics.readthedocs.org/>.

# Troubleshooting

If you were watching for the events in [Kissmetrics Live][live] and did not see them, it helps to review what our library logged. The Python library keeps a log file at:

* `/tmp/kissmetrics_error.log`

If you contact support to troubleshoot, please refer to the contents of these files, if possible.
