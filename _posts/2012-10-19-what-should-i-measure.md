While Kissmetrics' JavaScript library automatically records a ton of information about where your customers came from -- referrer, search terms, campaigns -- you will need to tell us how to recognize the important behaviors that customers do on your site.

The simplest way to think about it is: **what are the** ***most critical steps*** **that your prospective customer takes between landing on your site and you making money?**

They need to be able to:

## Sign up / Start using your site:

* Viewed Signup or Pricing Page
* Signed Up
* Authenticated via Facebook Connect or Twitter

## Get value from your product

It's not enough for customers to sign up or make a purchase, they actually need to be able to use and get value from your site. Whatever the core features of your service or site are, make sure customers are using them!

* Configured Service (so they can start using and getting value from it)
* Started Using Core Feature
* Successfully Completed Core Action

## Start paying you (or pay you more):

* Viewed Upgrade Page
* Clicked on Upgrade Call-to-Action
* Upgraded
* Viewed Billing Info Page
* Billed

## Find things to buy and buy them:

* Searched for Product
* Viewed Individual Product
* Downloaded
* Added to Cart
* Completed Purchase

## And, of course, you'll need to track the events that lead to you losing revenues:

* Canceled
* Downgraded
* Refunded
* Unsubscribed from Newsletter

We strongly recommend starting with a shorter list of the most critical user behaviors. This will help you stay focused on the metrics that are most critical in driving your business. It's easy to add or change what you're tracking later, if you need to.
