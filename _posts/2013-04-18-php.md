Our PHP Library has the basic functionality laid out in our [API specifications][specs]. It allows you to record events and set properties. However, you might miss these features from our JavaScript library:

* No built-in mechanisms for generating and saving identities for your users
* No built-in mechanisms for automatically tying together *anonymous* and *named* identities.
* No built-in mechanisms for running A/B tests
* No automatic triggering of Events (such as detecting Search Engine traffic)

For these reasons we recommend our JavaScript Library to our users, and to use the PHP Library for recording events that occur server-side (account Upgrades may be an example of one such event). You might also consider looking at [other APIs][other] our customers have created.

## Setup

You can download a copy of the API from:

[https://github.com/kissmetrics/kissmetrics-php][php]

You will need your API key which you can find in your [site settings][site-settings].

## Usage

Before calling any of the common methods you **must** call `KM::init` with a valid API key:

{% highlight php %}
<?
 KM::init(string $KM_KEY [, array $options])
?>
{% endhighlight %}

The available options are:

* `log_dir` - sets the logging directory. Default is `'/tmp'`
* `use_cron` - toggles whether to send data directly to Kissmetrics, or log to a file and send in the background via cron (see [Sending Data with Cron][cron] for more information). Default is `false`, which means data is sent directly to Kissmetrics and cron is not required, however is is **recommended**.
* `to_stderr` - allows toggling of printing output to `stderr`. Default is `true`.

Example:

{% highlight php %}
<?
 KM::init("this is your key", array(
  'log_dir' => '/var/logs/kissmetrics/'
));
?>
{% endhighlight %}

## Example Calls

{% highlight php %}
<?php
  KM::identify('bob@bob.com');
  KM::record('Viewed Homepage');
  KM::record('Signed Up', array('Plan' => 'Pro', 'Amount' => 99.95));
  KM::record('Signed Up', array('_d' => 1, '_t' => 1234567890));
  KM::set(array('gender'=>'male'));
?>
{% endhighlight %}

## Combining the PHP and JavaScript Libraries

You can let our JavaScript library handle creating anonymized identities for new visitors, so that all the PHP library needs to do is read the relevant cookie values. (The cookies are described in our [JavaScript Library documentation][js-cookies].)

### Initialization code

{% highlight html+php %}
<?php
require 'km.php';

function read_js_identity() {
  if (isset($_COOKIE['km_ni'])) {
    return $_COOKIE['km_ni'];
  } else if (isset($_COOKIE['km_ai'])) {
    return $_COOKIE['km_ai'];
  }
}

function km_init() {
  KM::init(
    '__REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_API_KEY__',
    array('log_dir' => '__YOUR_PREFERRED_LOG_DIR__')
  );

  // This example assumes you have a $current_user, with a
  // property "email". Use whatever makes sense for your
  // app.
  if ($current_user) {
    $identity = $current_user->email;
  } else {
    $identity = read_js_identity();
  }

  // If there's no identity found, and you need to track data
  // on the initial request, then you'll need to create your
  // own anonymous ID.
  // Otherwise, on subsequent requests, you will have access
  // to the km_ni and/or km_ai values once the JavaScript has
  // set a cookie value.
  if ($identity) {
    KM::identify($identity);
  }
}
?>
{% endhighlight %}

### Layout/template code:

{% highlight html+php %}
<?php if ($identity) { ?>
  <script type="text/javascript">
    var _kmq = _kmq || [];
    _kmq.push(['identify', '<?php echo $identity ?>']);
  </script>
<?php } ?>
{% endhighlight %}

## Troubleshooting

If you were watching for the events in [Kissmetrics Live][live] and did not see them, it helps to review what our library logged. In the log directory, you may see these files:

* `kissmetrics_error.log`
* `kissmetrics_query.log`
* `kissmetrics_sending.log`

If you contact support to troubleshoot, please refer to the contents of these files, if possible.
