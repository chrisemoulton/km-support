<p>Kissmetrics provides an official API for several languages. For most users we recommend using the JavaScript Library. Please also consider using our <a href='/getting-started/ways-to-send-us-data'>other ways of sending us data</a>, as we are including direct integrations with several platforms like Mailchimp, Recurly, and your own MySQL database.</p>
