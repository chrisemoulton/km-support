<p>Kissmetrics offers the ability to add data from other external data sources into Kissmetrics.</p>

<p>If your platform is not listed, please see if your platform has a data-out API - for example, <a href='https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api'>Twitter</a> and <a href='http://api.shopify.com/'>Shopify</a> provide APIs for retrieving data. If you can get data out of your platform, then you can potentially <a href='/advanced/importing-data'>import it back into Kissmetrics</a>.</p>
